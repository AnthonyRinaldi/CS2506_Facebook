Project 3 program for CS2506. 

I have worked as much as I can on this program in the time alloted. I fully admit I should have started much earlier on it, but alas the time is upon me.
At this time, I was able to garner 23.0 points before the grader died. 

Useage is standard. Both file and interactive modes work flawlessly. add_user works. add_friend does, with the exception that it is not in alphabetical order. delete_friend works, however delete_user was causing many problems and implimentation was not finished. search via name works, as does display_graph and many error cases of various tasks.

Again, I am sorry, and I do intend to continue working towards completion of this project during amnesty week.
